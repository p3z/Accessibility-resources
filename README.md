# Accessibility-resources

Hey guys,

So this is a very slowly growing list of resources that I've uncovered over the last year or so on the topic of web accessibility.

It's divided into a section of tools, general resources, and search terms I've used that have returned some compelling results, either in conversation (eg such as on Reddit) or via Google.

Enjoy and stay safe out there!
